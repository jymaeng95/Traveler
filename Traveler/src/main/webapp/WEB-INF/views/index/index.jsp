								<span class="first-character sc">I</span>n 1978, Brian Smith
								landed in Southern California with a bag of sheepskin boots and
								hope. He fell in love with the sheepskin experience and was
								convinced the world would one day share this love. The beaches
								of Southern California had long been an epicenter of a relaxed,
								casual lifestyle, a lifestyle that Brian felt was a perfect fit
								for his brand. So he founded the UGG brand, began selling his
								sheepskin boots and they were an immediate sensation. By the mid
								1980's, the UGG brand became a symbol of relaxed southern
								California culture, gaining momentum through surf shops and
								other shops up and down the coast of California, from San Diego
								to Santa Cruz. UGG boots reached beyond the beach, popping up in
								big cities and small towns all over, and in every level of
								society. Girls wore their surfer boyfriend's pair of UGG boots
								like a letterman jacket. When winter came along, UGG boots were
								in ski shops and were seen in lodges from Mammoth to Aspen.

								<span class="first-character ny">B</span>reaking into the New
								York fashion world is no easy task. But by the early 2000's, UGG
								Australia began to take it by storm. The evolution of UGG from a
								brand that made sheepskin boots, slippers, clogs and sandals for
								an active, outdoor lifestyle to a brand that was now being
								touted as a symbol of a stylish, casual and luxurious lifestyle
								was swift. Much of this was due to a brand repositioning effort
								that transformed UGG into a high-end luxury footwear maker. As a
								fashion brand, UGG advertisements now graced the pages of Vogue
								Magazine as well as other fashion books. In the mid 2000's, the
								desire for premium casual fashion was popping up all over the
								world and UGG was now perfectly aligned with this movement.

								fashion community notices your brand, the world soon follows.
								The widespread love for UGG extended to Europe in the mid-2000's
								along with the stylish casual movement and demand for premium
								casual fashion. UGG boots and shoes were now seen walking the
								streets of London, Paris and Amsterdam with regularity. To meet
								the rising demand from new fans, UGG opened flagship stores in
								the UK and an additional location in Moscow. As the love spread
								farther East, concept stores were opened in Beijing, Shanghai
								and Tokyo. UGG Australia is now an international brand that is
								loved by all. This love is a result of a magical combination of
								the amazing functional benefits of sheepskin and the heightened
								emotional feeling you get when you slip them on your feet. In
								short, you just feel better all over when you wear UGG boots,
								slippers, and shoes.
